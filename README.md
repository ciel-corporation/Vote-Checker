### Prerequisites

Before starting, you will need to have the following tools installed on your machine: [Git](https://git-scm.com), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). it's nice to have an editor to work with code like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### üé≤ Running the bot

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/ciel-corporation/Vote-Checker.git

# Access the project folder in terminal/cmd
$ cd Vote-Checker

# Rename config.example.json to config.json
$ mv config.example.json config.json

# Fill in the config.json file

# Install the dependencies

# Run the application
$ npm start

# If you are doing everything right the bot will be online
```
